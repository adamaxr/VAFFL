Do not draft on an IPAD (keepers aren't shown correctly)
NO pickups week 1, make sure you draft a full team.

Beware of Yahoo glitches:
IR glitch  If you have someone on IR and they become healthy you can keep them on IR but you will be locked from picking up players UNLESS you entered your bid prior to their status changing.  In the meantime you can change your lineup, you will have to drop a player if you put the IR player in. 
If you pick up a D and have an open D slot, your new D won't automatically go in there (careful with overseas games). 
No pickups week 1 (draft a full team)
