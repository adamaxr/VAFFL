# VAFFL Project Rules

## CRITICAL - Data Integrity
- NEVER fabricate, invent, or guess any data
- All player names, scores, and statistics MUST come from screenshots in the project folders
- If a screenshot is unclear or unreadable, ASK for clarification - do not guess
- When transcribing from images, verify EACH value carefully before saving
- If data seems unusual or wrong, flag it for review

## Data Sources
- Playoff data: Use screenshots in `2024 playoffs/`, `2023 playoffs/`, `2025 playoffs/` folders
- Draft data: Use screenshot images, do not attempt to recreate as tables
- Payout data: Use text files provided by user

## Playoff Page Data Requirements
Every playoff page MUST include the following data for consistency:

### Team Header Data
- Team name
- Manager name
- Record (e.g., "9-5-0 | 2nd")
- Final score
- Projected score (proj)

### Player Data (Starters AND Bench)
For EACH player, include ALL of these fields:
- pos: Position (QB, WR, RB, TE, W/R/T, Q/W, DEF)
- name: Player name
- team: NFL team abbreviation
- proj: Projected points
- pts: Actual points scored
- stats: Game statistics (e.g., "3 Pass TD, 295 Pass Yds, 44 Rush Yds")
- game: Game result (e.g., "W 37-24 vs Ten" or "L 19-33 vs Bal")

## Before Making Changes
- Read the actual source file/image first
- Double-check all numbers against the source
- If uncertain about any value, ask the user
